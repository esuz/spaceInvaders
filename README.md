# spaceInvaders
Adaption of Pytorch's RL tutorial of CartPole-v0 for the game Space Invaders.

Uses to DQN algorithm in combination with target and policy network. 

I'm currently using a google cloud GPU and pay about 40 cents per hour. According to this [medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/atari-reinforcement-learning-in-depth-part-1-ddqn-ceaa762a546f) it takes about 40 h to train on one of those fancy Tesla K80 GPUs, which means about 16 dollar. A sum I am not willing to pay at the moment. When I have access to free GPU will I try to train this model or maybe use Google Colab or something.
